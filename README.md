# SnipMate  
**SnipMate** is a macOS Menu Bar app that allows users to store, manage, and quickly access frequently used text snippets. Designed for professionals, developers, and anyone who frequently needs to reuse pieces of text.

SnipMate simplifies the process of managing reusable text snippets. Whether you’re dealing with emails, code snippets, addresses, or commands, this macOS app offers a quick way to organize and access them directly from the menu bar. SnipMate ensures you always have your snippets ready, without the need to search through files or documents.

This was built as my senior project for Brigham Young University-Idaho and emphasizes macOS app development using SwiftUI.
